# Video-Project
This is a simple webpage that plays a looping background video with a custom play/pause toggle button and a preloader animation.

## Features
1. Preloader – A loading screen appears before the main content is displayed.
2. Background Video – The video runs in full screen with overlay text.
3. Custom Play/Pause Button – A toggle button lets you pause and resume the video.
4. Responsive Layout – Works on different screen sizes with clean styles.

## Project Structure
1. index.html – Contains the webpage structure with video, preloader, and toggle button.
2. styles.css – Handles all the styling, including layout, button design, and responsiveness.
3. app.js – Contains JavaScript for preloader functionality and the play/pause button logic.
4. video.mp4 – The sample background video.
5. preloader.gif – The loading animation image.

## How It Works
1. When the page loads, the **preloader** is shown until everything is ready.
2. The **video** starts playing automatically in the background.
3. The **toggle button** can pause or resume the video with a sliding switch effect.

## How to Use
1. Clone or download the repository.
2. Make sure you have `video.mp4` and `preloader.gif` in the same folder.
3. Open `index.html` in your browser.
